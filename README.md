The original paper can be found [here](https://www.emis.de/journals/JIS/VOL15/Nilsson/nilsson5.pdf). This program verifies the conjecture that there are as many 1s as there are 2s in the [Kolakoski sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolakoski_sequence), up to $3\cdot10^8$, which was the first term count used in a published Kolakoski brute-forcing [paper](https://www.emis.de/journals/JIS/VOL9/Steinsky/steinsky5.pdf). The buffer used by this program is overkill. Even though it is under 1 MB, it would be enough to compute an astronomical number of sequence terms.
